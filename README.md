In this repo you can find my homework in ML COurse in 2021-2022 with later alterations and brush

## KNN
In this lesson I explore basic ML usge on example of KNN classification and regression tasks of sklearns fashion-mnist and diabetes datasets.

## Linear
In this homework you can find some implementation from scratch of linear and logistic regression.

## Cluster
In this homework you can find examples of clustering aproaches including k-means, t-SNE, DBSCAN, tuning of algorithms and inferring of cells types from clustering data.

## Class
Here you can find small excercise in classification on kaggle `music-genre-classification` dataset.
Basic classification approaches are used.

### Ensembles
In this homework you can find examples of usage of random forest, ensembles and boosting based on sklearn and different gradient boosting libraries

### Conv
In the Homework you can find AlexNet (convolutional neural network) replication with use of `pytorch`

### Image_class
Here you can find an unfinished prject on classification of images of arthropods.

### FC_NN
Here you can find implementation of fully connected multilayer perceptron. Different optimizers and ativation functions are compared. 
Pytorch library is used
